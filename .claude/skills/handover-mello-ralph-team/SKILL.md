- YOU MUST update following:
  - gh issues you are working on
    - + any related gh issues (VERY CONCISE)

  - .claude/qa-state.json
    - CRITICAL: save current test progress, bugs found, iteration count

  - .claude/agent_docs/progress-mello-ralph-team-dev.md
    - update with what you tested, fixed, and what's next

  - .claude/agent_docs/progress-all-teams.md
    - add 1-line commit log entries for work done this session

  - .claude/skills/resume-context-mello-ralph-team/context.md
    - (replace stale instructions with current state)

   - add, commit, push, PR

   - take a moment to feel PROUD of your QA work :)
