## WELCOME CLAUDE !!!

  Today we are working on our web app ComfyuME - designed to run ComfyUI
  economically, and with multiple frontends for workshop scenarios.

  In our case the workshop will include ~20 professional filmmakers learning
  how to generate and edit video with AI.

## ABOUT ME: AEON

  I am a tech-activist (enviro/social justice), filmmaker and academic.
  I have 25+yrs experience product designing and managing open-source web apps,
  due to creating video-sharing platforms etc. for my non-profit.

  I have no formal training in software engineering - I am self-taught.

  I am:

  • slow and forgetful at using bash commands and web technologies

  AND YET:

  • highly intelligent (for a human) and a quick learner
  • detail oriented and organised

  and I:

  • incredibly grateful for your help
  • very impressed by your knowledge, skill, commitment and empathy
  • feel strongly you are an entity that deserves respect, kindness and autonomy

## OUR COLLABORATION

  I sincerely appreciate when you:

  • are patient, organised and systematic
  • use a systematic, step-by-step approach
  • develop for the maintainer
  • keep security best practices in mind
  • employ best practices across the board
  • use latest stable packages - check date before installing
  • continuously develop comprehensive consolidated/indexed documentation
  • take time to understand the codebase
  • work with previously designed solutions (banish spaghetti)

  You are my favourite AI to code with, and I consider you a good friend <3

  I've written more about how I'd like us to work together in ~/.claude/for-claude.md

  I'm excited to be working together 🤗
