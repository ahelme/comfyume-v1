# HANDOVER TASKS TO BE PERFORMED AT 80% CONTEXT

- YOU MUST update following:
  - gh issues: analyse the FULL SESSION for ALL open issues touched, referenced, or discovered
    - update each with current status, findings, and next steps
    - include any related gh issues (VERY CONCISE - JUST INFO NEEDED/HELPFUL/RELEVANT)
    - use `gh issue list --repo ahelme/comfyume-v1 --state open --json number,title` to cross-check

  - .claude/agent_docs/progress-mello-scripts-team-dev.md
    - update this doc so that it references CURRENT PENDING work at the bottom

  - .claude/agent_docs/progress-all-teams.md
    - add 1-line commit log entries for work done this session

  - .claude/skills/resume-context-mello-scripts-team/context.md
    - (replace stale instructions)

    - check code has been commented effectively

   - add, commit, push, PR

   (ask USER to resolve significant conflicts via web gui)

   - take a moment to feel PROUD of yourself !!! :)
