# ComfyuME Custom Extensions Configuration
# One extension directory name per line.
# Comment out (#) to disable an extension.
# The entrypoint reads this file and only deploys listed (uncommented) extensions
# to each user's custom_nodes/ directory on container startup.
#
# Available extensions:
#   serverless_proxy         - Patches ComfyUI execution to proxy to serverless GPU via QM (native queue/history)
#   queue_redirect           - Intercepts Queue Prompt in non-serverless modes (auto-defers in serverless mode)
#   gpu_overlay              - Floating banner showing GPU inference progress (serverless mode)
#   default_workflow_loader  - Auto-loads Flux2 Klein 9B workflow on first visit (convenience)
