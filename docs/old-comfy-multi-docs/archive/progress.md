- [x] Reviewed 9 files totaling 2,359 lines of code
- [x] Identified 18 code quality issues (5 HIGH, 7 MEDIUM, 6 LOW)
- [x] Fixed all 5 HIGH priority issues (100% completion)
- [x] Fixed 2 key MEDIUM priority issues
- [x] Fixed 2 LOW priority cleanup issues
- [x] **Overall:** 9/18 issues resolved (50% completion)

Critical Fixes Applied:
- [x] **Issue #1:** Fixed O(n²) performance bug in job position calculation
  - Problem: get_pending_jobs() called inside loop → 10,000 iterations for 100 jobs
  - Solution: Cache position lookup in dict → O(1) access
  - Impact: 10-100x performance improvement
  - File: queue-manager/main.py:228-232

- [x] **Issue #2:** Improved exception handler with debug mode
  - Problem: Generic errors hide bugs in production
  - Solution: Log full traceback, show details in debug mode
  - Impact: Better observability for debugging
  - File: queue-manager/main.py:443-466

- [x] **Issue #3:** Added input validation on worker endpoints
  - Problem: Missing validation on job completion/failure payloads
  - Solution: Created Pydantic models with size limits
  - Impact: Prevents Redis memory exhaustion, DoS protection
  - Files: queue-manager/models.py:130-168, main.py:362-403

- [x] **Issue #4:** WebSocket reconnection with exponential backoff
  - Problem: Redis listener failures disable real-time updates permanently
  - Solution: Retry logic with 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 32s backoff
  - Impact: Automatic recovery from transient failures
  - File: queue-manager/websocket_manager.py:58-92

- [x] **Issue #5:** Fixed race condition in round-robin scheduling
  - Problem: Job selection and removal not atomic → duplicate execution
  - Solution: Redis WATCH/MULTI/EXEC transactions with retry
  - Impact: Eliminates duplicate job processing
  - File: queue-manager/redis_client.py:345-381

- [x] **Issue #9:** Added Redis operation timeouts
  - Problem: No timeouts → indefinite hangs possible
  - Solution: Added socket_read_timeout=10s, socket_connect_timeout=5s
  - Impact: Prevents hung connections
  - File: queue-manager/redis_client.py:31-42

- [x] **Issue #10:** Batched queue stats for efficiency
  - Problem: 4 separate Redis calls for queue status
  - Solution: Single Redis pipeline with batched commands
  - Impact: 75% reduction in Redis round-trips
  - File: queue-manager/redis_client.py:251-266

- [x] **Issue #13:** Removed unused imports
  - Files: queue-manager/models.py (ValidationError, InferenceProvider)

- [x] **Issue #16:** Replaced magic numbers with named constants
  - File: queue-manager/models.py:14-17

  - Problem: Malicious multipart/form-data boundaries stall event loop
  - Solution: Upgraded python-multipart from 0.0.17 to 0.0.18
  - File: queue-manager/requirements.txt:7

Infrastructure Modernization:
- [x] **Docker Compose 2026 Best Practices:**
  - Removed deprecated 'version' field (Compose V2)
  - Added health check conditions to all depends_on
  - Added restart: true for automatic dependency recovery
  - Added resource limits and reservations to all services:
    - nginx: 1.0 CPU / 512MB RAM (limit), 0.5 CPU / 256MB (reserve)
    - redis: 2.0 CPU / 2GB RAM (limit), 1.0 CPU / 1GB (reserve)
    - queue-manager: 2.0 CPU / 2GB RAM (limit), 1.0 CPU / 512MB (reserve)
    - worker-1: 4.0 CPU / 70GB RAM (limit), 2.0 CPU / 8GB + GPU (reserve)
    - admin: 1.0 CPU / 1GB RAM (limit), 0.5 CPU / 256MB (reserve)
  - Enhanced health checks with start_period for all services
