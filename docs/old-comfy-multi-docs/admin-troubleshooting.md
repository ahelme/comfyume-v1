# Admin Troubleshooting Guide - Quick Reference

This is a quick reference guide to troubleshooting resources. For detailed solutions, see the problem-specific guides below.

## Quick Diagnosis Commands

```bash
# Complete system status
./scripts/status.sh

# Check all services are running
docker-compose ps

# View system resource usage
docker stats

# Queue status
curl https://comfy.ahelme.net/api/queue/status

# Redis connectivity
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli -a $REDIS_PASSWORD ping

# Worker logs
docker-compose logs worker-1 | tail -20

# Nginx errors
docker-compose logs nginx | grep ERROR
```

## Performance Metrics to Monitor

| Metric | Good | Warning | Critical |
|--------|------|---------|----------|
| **GPU Memory** | < 70% | 70-85% | > 85% |
| **Queue Depth** | < 5 | 5-20 | > 20 |
| **Job Time (simple)** | < 2 min | 2-5 min | > 5 min |
| **Failed Jobs** | 0% | < 1% | > 5% |
| **Uptime** | > 99% | 95-99% | < 95% |

## Emergency Procedures

### CRITICAL: Server Completely Unresponsive

**If VPS/server stops responding and you cannot SSH or access services:**

1. **Hard Reset** the server via hosting provider dashboard (Hetzner Cloud Console, etc.)
2. **SSH in immediately** after reboot
3. **Stop ComfyUI containers** to prevent resource exhaustion:
   ```bash
   sudo docker stop $(sudo docker ps -q --filter "name=comfy")
   ```

This prevents all ComfyUI containers from auto-starting and consuming resources before you can diagnose the issue.

**Then investigate:**
```bash
# Check disk space (common cause)
df -h

# Check memory
free -h

# Check what was consuming resources before reboot
journalctl -b -1 | grep -i "oom\|killed"
```

### Complete System Restart

```bash
# Stop everything
docker-compose down

# Remove cache (if corrupted)
docker system prune -a

# Restart everything
docker-compose up -d

# Verify
docker-compose ps
curl https://comfy.ahelme.net/health
```

### Check Logs for Errors

```bash
# All errors
docker-compose logs | grep -i error

# Follow in real-time
docker-compose logs -f | grep -i error

# Export to file
docker-compose logs > full-logs.txt
grep -i "error\|warning" full-logs.txt
```
