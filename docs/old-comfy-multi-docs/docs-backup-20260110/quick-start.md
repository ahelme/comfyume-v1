# Quick Start Guide - Your First 5 Minutes

Welcome! This guide will get you creating AI images in under 5 minutes. 🚀

## Step 1: Open Your Workspace (30 seconds)

You've been assigned a personal workspace. Open it in your browser:

```
https://comfy.ahelme.net/user001/
```
*(Replace `user001` with your assigned number)*

**What you'll see:**
- A canvas with colorful nodes connected by lines
- A sidebar on the left with tools
- Buttons at the top for saving and loading

**Don't panic!** It looks complex, but we'll start simple. 😊

---

## Step 2: Load a Pre-Made Workflow (1 minute)

Instead of building from scratch, let's use a template:

1. Click the **📁 folder icon** (top-left corner)
2. Navigate to `/workflows/` in the file browser
3. Click **`01_intro_text_to_image.json`**
4. Click **Open**

**You should see:** A simple workflow with 5-6 colorful boxes connected by lines.

---

## Step 3: Customize Your Prompt (2 minutes)

Find the blue box labeled **"CLIP Text Encode (Prompt)"**:

1. Click anywhere inside the blue box
2. Find the text field (it probably says something like "a beautiful landscape")
3. **Change it to YOUR idea!** For example:
   - `"a magical forest at sunset, glowing mushrooms, fantasy art"`
   - `"a cute robot reading a book, studio lighting, detailed"`
   - `"cyberpunk city at night, neon lights, cinematic"`

**Pro tip:** Be specific! The more details you add, the better the result.

---

## Step 4: Queue Your Job (30 seconds)

1. Click the **"Queue Prompt"** button (top-right, big button)
2. A popup appears showing:
   - ✅ Job submitted!
   - Your position in queue (e.g., "Position #3")
   - Estimated wait time

**Now wait!** Everyone shares the same GPU, so jobs process one at a time.

---

## Step 5: See Your Result! (wait time varies)

When it's your turn:
- The popup will show "⚙️ Processing..."
- Progress updates in real-time
- When done: "✅ Complete! Outputs ready"

**Your image appears** in the output panel (usually bottom-right).

### Download Your Image

1. Right-click on the output image
2. Select **"Save image"** or **"Open in new tab"**
3. Save to your computer!

## 🎉 Congratulations!

You just created your first AI-generated image!

**What's next?**
- Try changing the prompt and clicking Queue Prompt again
- Experiment with different descriptions
- Ask the instructor for help with advanced features

## Common Questions

**Q: Why is my job taking so long?**
A: Everyone shares one GPU. If there are 10 people ahead of you, you'll wait for ~10 jobs to finish. Be patient! ⏱️

**Q: Where did my image go?**
A: All your outputs are saved in your workspace. They won't disappear!

**Q: Can I start over?**
A: Yes! Just load a new workflow from the folder icon.

**Q: What if something breaks?**
A: Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R). Your work is auto-saved.

**Q: How do I upload my own image?**
A: See [How-To Guides](./how-to-guides.md#upload-your-own-images)
