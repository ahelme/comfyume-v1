**Critical URLs:**
| Resource | URL |
|----------|-----|
| **Health Check** | https://comfy.ahelme.net/health |
| **Admin Dashboard** | https://comfy.ahelme.net/admin |
| **API Endpoint** | https://comfy.ahelme.net/api/ |
| **Instructor Workspace** | https://comfy.ahelme.net/user001 |
| **Participant Workspaces** | https://comfy.ahelme.net/user002 through user020 |

**Critical SSH Access:**
```bash
# Hetzner VPS
ssh desk

# GPU Instance

```

---

## 💡 Basics

### System Monitoring

```bash
# Overall system health
./scripts/status.sh

# Check all services running
docker-compose ps

# Check web endpoints
curl https://comfy.ahelme.net/health
```

### Common Admin Tasks

**Cancel a stuck job:** Open Admin Dashboard → Find job → Click Cancel

**Prioritize instructor demo:** Open Admin Dashboard → Find your job → Click Prioritize

**Check queue depth:** `curl https://comfy.ahelme.net/api/queue/status`

**View worker logs:** `docker-compose logs worker-1 | tail -20`

### Health Checks

**Web-based health check:**
```bash
https://comfy.ahelme.net/health
```

**Manual connectivity test:**
```bash
# From GPU instance, test Redis connection to VPS
redis-cli -h comfy.ahelme.net -p 6379 -a $REDIS_PASSWORD ping
```

### Network Connectivity Tests

**Verify DNS:**
```bash
nslookup comfy.ahelme.net
# Should return VPS IP address
```

**Test HTTPS:**
```bash
curl -v https://comfy.ahelme.net/health
# Should get 200 OK with valid SSL certificate
```

**Test Redis from GPU:**
```bash
redis-cli -h comfy.ahelme.net -p 6379 -a $REDIS_PASSWORD ping
# Should get: PONG
```

## 📋 Critical Files and Locations

| File/Directory | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `.env` | Configuration (passwords, domain, etc.) |
| `USER_CREDENTIALS.txt` | Plain-text user credentials (gitignored, see Security Guide) |
| `/etc/nginx/comfyui-users.htpasswd` | Encrypted user passwords for HTTP Basic Auth |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Container orchestration |
| `/etc/ssl/certs/fullchain.pem` | SSL public certificate |
| `/etc/ssl/private/privkey.pem` | SSL private key |
| `data/models/shared/` | Shared model files |
| `data/outputs/` | User output files (isolated per user) |
| `scripts/status.sh` | System health check script |
| `scripts/start.sh` | Start all services |
| `scripts/stop.sh` | Stop all services |

---

## 🔧 Essential Scripts

```bash
# Start all services
./scripts/start.sh

# Stop all services
./scripts/stop.sh

# System health check
./scripts/status.sh

# Add a new user (user021+)
./scripts/add-user.sh user021

# Remove a user
./scripts/remove-user.sh user021

# List all users and stats
./scripts/list-users.sh
```

## 🎓 Two-Tier Architecture

The system is split across two servers:

**Hetzner VPS (App Server):**
- Hosts 20 user frontends (CPU-only, no GPU)
- Runs queue manager and Redis
- Serves HTTPS with SSL
- Lightweight

**Remote GPU Instance (Compute Server):**
- Runs GPU workers (ComfyUI + GPU)
- Connects back to VPS via Redis
- Executes actual image/video generation
- Heavy lifting

**Benefits:**
- Users don't compete for GPU resources
- GPU instance can be scaled independently
- Can use cloud GPU providers (Verda, RunPod, Modal)
- One H100 serves 20 users efficiently
